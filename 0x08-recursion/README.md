# **Recursion**

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering** studies at ***Alx and  Holberton School***. It aims to learn about recursion and how to implement it in C language.


## Tecnologies and Requirements.

+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
* All your files should end with a new line.
+ Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables.
* No more than 5 functions per file.
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar.
_ The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
- You are not allowed to use any kind of loops.
* You are not allowed to use static variables.


**Files**
All of the following files are programs written in C:

|Filename	|Description|
|----------|----------|
|0-puts_recursion.c|	Prints a string
|1-print_rev_recursion.c|	Prints a string in reverse
|2-strlen_recursion.c|	Returns the length of a string
|3-factorial.c|	Returns the factorial of a given number
|4-pow_recursion.c|	Returns the value of x raised to the power of y
|5-sqrt_recursion.c|	Returns the natural sqaure root of a number
|6-is_prime_number.c|	Returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0
|7-is_palindrome.c|	Returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not
|100-wildcmp.c|	Compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical. Otherwise, returns 0
