Functions, nested loops
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at Alx and Holberton School. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in C language.

Technologies and Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
