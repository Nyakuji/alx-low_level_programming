# **0x15-file_io**

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering** studies at ***Alx Africa/Holberton School***. It aims to learn about how to handle files (open, close, read and write), file descriptors, system calls and file permissions in C language.

## **TECHNOLOGIES AND REQUIREMENTS**

+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
+ No more than 5 functions per file
+ The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden


### **Files**

+ All of the following files are programs written in C:

|Filename	|Description|
|---------------|-----------|
|0-read_textfile.c|	Reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output
|1-create_file.c|	Creates a file
|2-append_text_to_file.c|	Appends text at the end of a file
|3-cp.c|	Copies the content of a file to another file
