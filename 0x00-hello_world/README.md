# Hello, World
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering** studies **at Alx and Holberton School**. It aims to learn about what is entry point, basics commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in C language.

## Technologies and Requirements
+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
+ All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
Files.
+ All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

 |FILENAME      DESCRIPTION     |           | 
 |-----------|-------------------|
 |0-preprocessor|	Runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file
 |1-compiler|	Compiles a C file but does not link
 |2-assembler|	Generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file
 |3-name|	Compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun
 |4-puts.c|	Prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"
 |5-printf.c	|Prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art
 |6-size.c	|Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled
 |100-intel|	Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file
 |101-quote.c|	Prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19
