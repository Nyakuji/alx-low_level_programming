# **Even more pointers, arrays and strings**

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering** studies at  ***Alx and Holberton School***. It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in C language.

## Technologies and Requirements

+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
+ No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h


**Files**
All of the following files are programs written in C:
