# **More pointers, arrays and strings**

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering** studies at ***Alx and Holberton School***. It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in C language.


## **Technologies and Requirements**.

+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
+ You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
